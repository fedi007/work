üõ†Ô∏è Deploying Jenkins on a Minikube Kubernetes Cluster

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

-kubectl

-minikube

-Docker (for the Minikube driver)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Minikube

Run the following commands to install Minikube on a Linux system:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64

sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

2Ô∏è‚É£ Starting Minikube

minikube start --driver=docker

minikube cluster is added to the kubeconfig file:

Verify that the nodes is ready for scheduling pods

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying Jenkins on Minikube

Prepared the need Kubernetes manifests:

- A Deployment for Jenkins

- A Service of type NodePort to expose Jenkins 

Once the pod is ruuning , I forwarded the service already created using:

minikube service jenkins -n jenkins , and the server is ready and responding :

4Ô∏è‚É£ Blue/Green Node.js Deployment

A sample Node.js application is deployed in the nodeapp namespace with both blue and green deployments.

The service is initially pointing to the blue deployment.

The application is accessible at: http://192.168.49.2:30080/ 


To switch the service to point to the green deployment:

kubectl patch service node-app \
  -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"app": "node-app", "version": "green"}}}'

‚öôÔ∏è Automating the Deployment

The setup is automated using a bash automation script , to run it do :

chmod 777 automation.sh 

./automation.sh


‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying Jenkins on AWS EKS using Terraform

1Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up EKS

- Navigate to the eks-tf/ directory.

- Initialize Terraform and apply the configurations using 

   ---> terraform init
   ---> terraform workspace new assessment
   --->    terraform apply

Then you can see that the cluster is creating from the AWS console :

Once the cluster is created :

2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Jenkins on EKS


After that , I am going now to launch jenkins ( with JDK 21) on the eks cluster using a helm chart , in which I will do updated based on my config (AWS/EKS)

I will use and efs voulme for creating the persistent volume and a claim for mounting Jenkins volume.

After creating a dedicated namespace I will do :

helm install jenkins jenkins_chart/ -n adad-jenkins 

once the jenkins is ready :

I will port forward to the service to access it :

Now We can access :

3Ô∏è‚É£ Integrating Jenkins with Kubernetes


Install the Kubernetes plugin in Jenkins and configure it to connect to the same EKS cluster it is running in.

This allows Jenkins to manage dynamic agents (pods) inside the EKS cluster.
